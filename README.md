## Objective
Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10
prime number.
 - The program must run from the command line and print one table to
STDOUT.
 - The first row and column of the table should have the 10 primes, with
each cell
containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and
column.

### Notes
 - Consider complexity. How fast does your code run? How does it scale?
 - Consider cases where we want N primes.
 - Do not use the Prime class from stdlib (write your own code).
 - Write tests. Try to demonstrate TDD/BDD.
 - If youâ€™re using external dependencies please specify those
dependencies and how to
install them.
 - Please package your code, OR include running instructions.

## Time complexity analysis
The time complexity for the solution is O($n^2$), where n is the number of prime numbers, because there are two nested loops for calculate the multiplication table. Probably is possible to use a more clever algorithm for do this work.
However the low bounder is $\Omega$(nlogn) that is the time complexity to get the first n prime  numbers by [distribution law of the prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem).

## How to configure
Execute the command:
```
gem install bundler && bundle
```

## How to test
Execute the command:
```
bundle exec rake test
```

## How to run
Execute the command:
```
./bin/prime_mult_table
```
or the command:
```
ruby bin/prime_mult_table
```
Also is possible to pass the number of prime as parameter:
```
./bin/prime_mult_table 6
```
or
```
ruby bin/prime_mult_table 6
```
